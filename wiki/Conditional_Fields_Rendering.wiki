#summary A simple way to render specific fields to specific renders

= Introduction =

If you render your data in several formats you probably want to render different fields based on format render.


=How?=

Let's suppose you have a query with 5 fields.

{{{
Name, City, Country, Id, Sex
}}}

Those fields will appear in every format you render. But if you want the table to have the Id field but the PDF not?

{{{
$grid->setPdfGridColumns(array('Name', 'City', 'Country', 'Sex'));
}}}
The code above will make that the PDF won't render the Id field.

You can do this to every deploy format. You only need to use this method

{{{
$grid->set[Deploy]GridColumns(array());
}}}

Examples:
{{{
$grid->setTableGridColumns(array());
$grid->setJsonGridColumns(array());
$grid->setCsvGridColumns(array());
$grid->setXmlGridColumns(array());
}}}

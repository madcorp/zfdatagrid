#summary Decorate you output


=What are decorators?=
Decorators, as the name itself indicates, decorate the result.
You can use a special code to specify the value of a certain field.
Lets assume you want to suffix the field value with a letter or a text.
The field name is _Population_ and you want the result something like this:

||has 12000 persons||

where 12000 is the field value coming from the db

To achieve this you only need to add a decorator:


{{{
$grid->updateColumn('Population',array('decorator'=>'has {{Population}} persons'));
}}}

Resulting in: ||has 12000 persons ||

The expression {{Population}} will be replaced by the field value _Population_

Although you are in the _Population_ column you can use others fields as well. 
{{{
$grid->updateColumn('Population',array('decorator'=>'{{Country}} has {{Population}} persons'));
}}}

Resulting in: ||Portugal has 12000 persons ||
